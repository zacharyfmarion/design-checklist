# Component Documentation

This section contains documentation for the react components found in the project. This documentation is auto-generated by [React-docgen](https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen). You can run the command `yarn docgen` in order to document all of the components. The file `scripts/docs.js` handles this process. It has a array called `locations` that defines the entry points for a recursive file traversal. Each file is then run through react-docgen and then the structured data is converted to markdown.

Welcome to the design-checklist wiki! Note that in the wiki I will be using `yarn` as the command for installing node modules and running commands. You can also use `npm`, they do the same thing.

## About

This is frontend code repo for the Design Checklist project, an attempt to provide students in Duke's compsci 308 course with insight into their Java code through static analysis. This repo uses [React](https://reactjs.org/) was the view framework and [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/) to handle data, familiarity with these libraries will be necessary to understand the code going forward. The [Antd Component Library](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) is used just for some simple design primitives. It also uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) for client side routing and [Recharts](http://recharts.org) for displaying graphics to the user. A full list of the project's dependencies can be found in the `package.json` file located in the root of the project.

## Getting started

See the repo's `README.md` on information about running the code locally.

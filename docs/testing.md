## How to Test

Testing is done with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) and [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/). Currently there is not much test coverage but this could definitely be improved in the future. For an example of how to test files look in `scenes/Graphs/GraphsStore.test.js`. You can run tests with `yarn test`. They are also automatically run with CircleCI every time a commit is pushed to github.
